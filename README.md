# Daily Deals

Daily Deals is an application built with Angular 2 that shows how you can add token based authentication to your Angular 2 applications. 

## Development server
Install the dependencies for this application by running `npm install`. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Auth0 Credentials

You will need an Auth0 Account to implement the Authentication Service. [Sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for a free account. Edit the `auth.service.ts` file and update the ClientID and Domain with your Auth0 credentials.

*Note: Be sure to run the server portion of this project first, otherwise you won't see any data that is called from the API.*

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
